# NuxtPress - Nuxt's VitePress Alternative

## NuxtPress

VitePress is my preferred choice for writing documentations however when using NuxtJS we tend to use Nuxt Content and awesome modules like [Nuxt-OGImage](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/og-image).

When I started with Nuxt Content, It requires setting up lots of things like styles, typography, custom components, etc. I really loved VitePress's UI and wanted to use it with Nuxt Content.

Finally, I created NuxtPress, a VitePress alternative for Nuxt Content. It's a simple and clean and Nuxt Content. Good thing is you can also use it with [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio/) to edit your site like CMS and check the instant preview unlike VitePress where you've to spin up the dev server and check the preview.

One of the reasons I created NuxtPress is to use it for docs & blog of my new product [WrapWithAI](https://wrapwithai.com/) - Workflow Automation that is simple, Affordable & AI Centric.

## Is NuxtPress ready for production?

Yes, NuxtPress is ready for production but I'm still implementing features missing from VitePress. You can check the [features](/docs/markdown) supported by NuxtPress right now.

As I mentioned earlier, I'll be using it for my own product's docs & blog. I'll be adding more features as I need them.

Stay tuned for more updates on NuxtPress. You can also contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jd-solanki/nuxtpress).
